## Introduction

Portpoliwo is my simple personal portfolio application. This application uses [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel "Laravel") as backend, and [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue "Vue.js") as SPA.

> This is my first Vue.js project.

## Features

- UUID as default primary database key
- SPA Authentication from Sanctum
- Site settings, works, social media lists, etc.
